    "\n",
    "Stemming is the process of reducing inflection in words i.e., reducing words to their root form especially words in past and continuous form e.g., `dancing` is reduced to its root `dance`. Most widely used stemming algorithm is the porter stemmer within the `nltk` library. Oftentimes some words are wrongly stemmed for example `navigation` may be reduced to `navig`. Run the cells below to see the effect of stemming on our text `(no_stopword_text)`.        "
