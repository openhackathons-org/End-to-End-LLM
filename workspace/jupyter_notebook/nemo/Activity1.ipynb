    "This lab activity is vital to test your understanding and assist you in perfecting what you have learned in the previous notebook. \n",
    "You are to reproduce the training and inferencing process for Question-answering using the already-used QuAC dataset. To complete the lab activity, you are to implement the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the structure of the QuAC dataset and process the `quac_v0.2.json` file into a training and validation set. You can decide the split ratio and preprocess the dataset into SQuAD JSON format.\n",
    "- Import important libraries and use the Bert model `BERTQAModel` for training and inferencing\n",
    "- Use `omegaconf` to:\n",
    "    - set dataset config values\n",
    "    - set trainer config values \n",
    "    - set experiment manager config values\n",
    "- Train and Test your Model\n",
    "- Run inference using the custom dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of the solution code is written for you. You are to complete the rest by filling in the statements with the missing value(s) in the commented areas of the notebook. We recommend consciously setting/modifying the `config.trainer.max_epochs` value as it determines the time to complete this lab. The lab activity should not exceed `45 mins`; therefore, the value of `config.trainer.max_epochs` should be between `1 and 6` as one epoch may take up to `7 mins`. If you plan to exceed these values, run this notebook after the Bootcamp active hours.\n",

    "Question Answering in Context is a dataset for modeling, understanding, and participating in information-seeking dialog. QuAC contains 98,407 QA pairs from 13,594 discussions. The dialogues were conducted on 8,854 unique sections from 3,611 unique Wikipedia articles, and every talk had between four and twelve questions. More information can be found on [Hugging Face dataset page](https://huggingface.co/datasets/quac).\n",
    "The Data instances consist of an interactive dialog between two crowd workers: (1) a student who poses a sequence of freeform questions to learn as much as possible about a hidden Wikipedia text, and (2) a teacher who answers the questions by providing short excerpts (spans) from the text. QuAC introduces challenges not found in existing machine comprehension datasets: its questions are often more open-ended, unanswerable, or only meaningful within the dialog context. You can read more from [QuAC's official website](https://quac.ai/).\n"

    "{'paragraphs': [{'context': 'Walton was born in La Mesa, California, the son of Gloria Anne (nee Hickey) and William Theodore \"Ted\" Walton. His listed adult playing height was 6 feet 11 inches; it has been reported that Walton is actually taller (7 feet 2 inches, or more) but does not like being categorized as a seven-footer. He played high school basketball at Helix High School. At age 17, Walton played for the United States men\\'s national basketball team at the 1970 FIBA World Championship. He played college basketball for John Wooden at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) from 1971 to 1974, winning the national title in 1972 over Florida State and again in 1973 with an 87-66 win over Memphis State in which Walton made 21 of 22 field goal attempts and scored 44 points, representing more than half his team\\'s total. The Walton-led 1971-72 UCLA basketball team had a record of 30-0, in the process winning its games by an average margin of more than 30 points. He was the backbone of two consecutive 30-0 seasons and was also part of UCLA\\'s NCAA men\\'s basketball record 88-game winning streak. The UCLA streak contributed to a personal winning streak that lasted almost five years, in which Walton\\'s high school, UCLA freshman (freshmen were ineligible for the varsity at that time) and UCLA varsity teams did not lose a game from the middle of his junior year of high school to the middle of his senior year in college. Walton was the 1973 recipient of the James E. Sullivan Award as the top amateur athlete in the United States. Walton also received the USBWA College Player of the Year and Naismith College Player of the Year as the top college basketball player in the country three years in a row while attending UCLA, at the same time earning Academic All-American honors three times. Some college basketball historians rate Walton as the greatest who ever played the game at the college level. In Walton\\'s senior year during the 1973-74 season, the school\\'s 88-game winning streak ended with a 71-70 loss to Notre Dame. During the same season, UCLA\\'s record seven consecutive national titles was broken when North Carolina State defeated the Bruins 80-77 in double overtime in the NCAA semi-finals. With Walton\\'s graduation in 1974 and Bruin coach John Wooden\\'s retirement after UCLA\\'s 1975 national title, the UCLA dynasty came to an end. Prior to joining the varsity team, Walton (18.1, 68.6 percent), along with Greg Lee (17.9 ppg) and Keith Wilkes (20.0 ppg), was a member of the 20-0 UCLA Freshman team. CANNOTANSWER',\n",
