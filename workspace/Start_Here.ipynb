    "\n",
    "End-to-End NLP material is designed from a real-world perspective that follows the data processing, development, and deployment pipeline paradigm. The material consists of three labs and the goal is to walk you through a single flow of raw text `data preprocessing` and how to build a SQuAD dataset format for Question Answering, train the dataset via `NVIDIA® TAO` transfer learning BERT model, and deploy using `RIVA`. Furthermore, a challenge notebook is introduced to test your understanding of the material and solidify your experience in the Question Answering (QA) domain.\n",
