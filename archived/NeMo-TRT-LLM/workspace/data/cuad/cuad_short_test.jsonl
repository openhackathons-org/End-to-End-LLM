{"taskname": "cuad", "context": "In 2010 the Amazon rainforest experienced another severe drought, in some ways more extreme than the 2005 drought. The affected region was approximately 1,160,000 square miles (3,000,000 km2) of rainforest, compared to 734,000 square miles (1,900,000 km2) in 2005. The 2010 drought had three epicenters where vegetation died off, whereas in 2005 the drought was focused on the southwestern part. The findings were published in the journal Science. In a typical year the Amazon absorbs 1.5 gigatons of carbon dioxide; during 2005 instead 5 gigatons were released and in 2010, 8 gigatons were released.", "question": "How many gigatons of carbon are absorbed by the Amazon in a typical year?"}

{"taskname": "cuad", "context": "The sun is a massive ball of hot, glowing gases at the center of our solar system. It provides light, heat, and energy that sustains life on Earth. The sun's surface temperature is around 5,500 degrees Celsius (9,932 degrees Fahrenheit), while its core temperature reaches about 15 million degrees Celsius (27 million degrees Fahrenheit). The sun's energy is generated through a process called nuclear fusion, where hydrogen atoms combine to form helium, releasing immense amounts of energy in the process.", "question": "What is the approximate surface temperature of the sun?"}
