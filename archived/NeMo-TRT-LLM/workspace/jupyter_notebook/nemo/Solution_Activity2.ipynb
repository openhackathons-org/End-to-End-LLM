    "In this lab, you are to reproduce the p-tuning and prompt-tuning process for the question-answering task using the CUAD dataset already available. To complete the activity, you are to implement the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the structure of the CUAD dataset and process the `CUAD_v1.json` file into a training and validation set. You are free to decide the split ratio. More detail is given below.\n",
    "- Setup your P-Tuning Model Config using omegaconf\n",
    "- Create the prompt formatting template and set the task\n",
    "- Set the pre-trained GPT model as `nemo_gpt1.3B_fp16.nemo` \n",
    "- Build the PyTorch lightning trainer and set all hyperparameters\n",
    "- Create the NeMo experiment manager\n",
    "- Run your p-tuning session\n",
    "- Restore your p-tuned model to run inference\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of the code is written for you. You are to complete the rest by filling in the statements with the missing value(s) in the commented areas of the notebook. We recommend consciously setting/modifying the `config.trainer.max_epochs` value as it determines the time to complete the lab. The lab activity should not exceed `45 mins`; therefore, the value of `config.trainer.max_epochs` should be between `1 and 6` as one epoch may take up to `7 mins`. If you plan to exceed these values, run this notebook after the Bootcamp active hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: *You are not expected to get the best result as this activity is for learning. To achieve better results, you can modify parameters: the number of epochs, learning rate, batch size, max step, training, and validation set sample size*.\n"

Racing represents to the Sponsor that the Sponsor\\'s aggregate obligation hereunder  will not exceed the amount of the sponsorship fee set forth in Section 3 hereof (or such lesser amount as is payable by the Sponsor in the event  that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 14 hereof), plus, if applicable, collection costs that may be reasonably incurred by Racing in  a legal proceeding to collect all or any part thereof (the \"Maximum Obligation\"). Racing agrees to indemnify the Sponsor and its officers, directors,  agents and employees and to hold them harmless from any loss, claim, cost, damage or liability in excess of the Maximum Obligation which (i) the  Sponsor shall incur as a result of this Agreement, or (ii) arises from any failure by Racing to perform any of its obligations hereunder.\\n\\n6. Retention of Rights. The only rights granted to the Sponsor hereunder are the right to receive the Benefits, and Racing hereby retains all  other rights with respect to the Racing Team, including but not limited to logos, symbols, names and other marks and intellectual property of the  Racing Team, and any proceeds derived by the Racing Team. The Sponsor hereby retains and does not grant any rights to Racing to use any of its  logos, symbols, names or other marks or intellectual property, except for use as described in Section 2 hereof. In the event that this Agreement is  terminated or if the sponsorship terminates at the end of the term provided for herein, each of the parties shall retain the rights to use its logos,  symbols, names or other marks or intellectual property including, in the case of the Sponsor, the right to use the names and marks \"GAINSCO 99\",  \"the GAINSCO 99 Car\", or similar phrases or derivations thereof.\\n\\n7. Relationship to Other Sponsors. The Sponsor acknowledges that Racing has arranged and may arrange in the future for other sponsors  for the Racing Team. Racing agrees that, during the term of this Agreement, (i) Sponsor shall have the right to approve or disapprove any  additional sponsor identified by Racing, and (ii) unless another proposed sponsor has agreed to pay a sponsorship fee that exceeds the amount  paid by Sponsor, no other sponsor shall receive any benefit of greater value (including either an equivalent or a more prominent use of another  sponsor\\'s name, logo or other identifying information) than the Benefits provided to the Sponsor hereunder.\\n\\n8. Insurance.   (a) Racing shall obtain and maintain, at Racing\\'s expense, comprehensive automobile liability insurance covering all owned, non-owned and  hired vehicles used by Racing in the Business with limits of not less than $5,000,000 per occurrence combined single limit for personal injury and  property damage, including all statutory coverage for all states of operation. Racing shall also provide comprehensive (fire and theft) and collision  insurance on each vehicle used in the Business. Racing shall provide the Sponsor a certificate of insurance evidencing \"Gainsco Inc. and all  related entities\" as additional insureds, stating that such insurance is primary in coverage to any other insurance which may be available the  Sponsor, and providing at least thirty (30) days\\' prior written notice to the Sponsor of cancellation, modification or material change to the policy.\\n\\n(b) Racing shall obtain and maintain pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, at its sole expense, the following types of insurance coverage,  with minimum limits as set forth below:\\n\\n(i) Commercial General Liability covering liability arising from premises, operations, independent contractors, personal and advertising injury  and contractual liability—$5,000,000 each occurrence.      3\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(ii) Racing Owners\\' Sponsors (Spectators) Legal Liability including Participant Legal Liability—$5,000,000 each occurrence.\\n\\n(iii) Business Automobile Liability covering all owned, hired and non-owned vehicles—$5,000,000 each occurrence, including statutory  coverages for all states of operations.\\n\\n(iv) Workers Compensation—statutory limits for all states of operation.\\n\\n(v) Employers Liability—$5,000,000 each employee for bodily injury by accident and $500,000 each employee for bodily injury by disease.\\n\\nAll policies of insurance procured by Racing herein shall be written as primary policies, not contributing with or in excess of coverage that the  Sponsor may carry. If Racing\\'s liability policies do not contain the standard separation of insureds provision, or a substantially similar clause, they  shall be endorsed to provide cross-liability coverage.\\n\\n(c) Racing shall provide the Sponsor with a certificate of insurance evidence compliance with the insurance requirements set forth above.  Certificates shall provide that \"Gainsco Inc. and all related entities\" shall be named as additional insureds on all liability policies, stating that such  insurance is primary in coverage to any other insurance which may be available to the Sponsor, and providing at least thirty (30) days\\' prior  written notice to the Sponsor of termination, cancellation, modification or material change to the policy.\\n\\n(d) Such certificates shall be in a form acceptable to, and underwritten by insurance company(ies) reasonably satisfactory to the Sponsor. By  requiring insurance herein, the Sponsor does not represent that coverage limits will necessarily be adequate to protect Racing. The purchase of  appropriate insurance coverage by Racing or the furnishing of certificates of insurance shall not release Racing from its obligations and liabilities  under this Agreement.\\n\\n9. Conduct. Racing and all Racing members, including but not limited to all drivers, agree to use best efforts to conduct themselves in such a  manner so as not to reflect unfavorably upon the Sponsor or its products. The Sponsor shall have the right to terminate this Agreement on written  notice to Racing if any driver, the general manager or any other member of Racing (i) fails to conduct himself/herself in accordance with generally  accepted standards of morality, (ii) engages in any activity which reflects adversely on the image, reputation or goodwill of the Sponsor or (iii)  disparages the products or services of the Sponsor; provided, however, the Sponsor shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement if Racing,  within fifteen (15) days after receipt of written notice by the Sponsor terminates the employment of, or otherwise dismisses from the racing team,  the driver(s), general manager(s) or other member(s) of Racing engaging in the offensive conduct. Upon termination, the Sponsor shall be entitled  to a pro rata refund of monies paid for services not yet performed by Racing based upon the number of races for the applicable racing season. The  Sponsor\\'s decision with respect to all matters arising under this Section shall be conclusive.      4\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n10. Remedies. If either party breaches any provision of this Agreement, the other party shall be entitled to seek monetary damages and, if  appropriate, equitable relief to require the performance of the obligations hereunder.\\n\\n11. Assignment. Neither party shall assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party.\\n\\n12. Entire Agreement; Amendment and Waiver; Confidentiality. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Racing and the  Sponsor with respect to the subject matter hereof and supercedes all prior agreements and understandings. Any amendment of this Agreement  must be by a written instrument signed by both parties, and any waiver of any provision hereof must be in writing, signed by the party agreeing to  such waiver. Each of the parties hereto agrees to hold in confidence the terms hereof and, unless otherwise required by law, neither party shall  release, disclose or publish any of the terms hereof without the prior written consent of the other party.\\n\\n13. Notices. All notices and communications to be made with respect to this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be effective only when  delivered by (i) hand, (ii) prepaid certified United States mail, return receipt requested, or (iii) overnight delivery service providing proof of delivery,  addressed as follows:\\n\\nIf to Racing:   Stallings Capital Group Consultants, Ltd., dba Bob Stallings Racing   Attention: Robert W.

Termination by the Sponsor. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1 hereof, the Sponsor shall have the right at any time prior to  December 31, 2010 to terminate this Agreement by giving written notice of such termination to Racing. In the event of such a termination, (i) the  Sponsor shall have no further obligation to make payments toward the sponsorship fee contemplated in Section 3 hereof, (ii) Racing shall have no  further obligation to provide any Benefits hereunder, and (iii) the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.\\n\\n15. Miscellaneous. (a) This Agreement may be executed in two counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but both of  which shall constitute a single agreement.      5\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(b) The headings and sections of this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not affect the interpretation of any provision hereof.\\n\\n(c) This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Texas, without giving effect to  principles of conflict of laws.\\n\\nThis Agreement is executed as of the date first above written.\\n\\n   6\\n\\nSTALLINGS CAPITAL GROUP CONSULTANTS, LTD., DBA BOB  STALLINGS RACING     GAINSCO, INC.\\n\\nBy:  /s/ Robert W.
