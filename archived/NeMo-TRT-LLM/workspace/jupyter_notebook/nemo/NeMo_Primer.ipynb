Neural Modules are conceptual blocks of neural networks that take typed inputs and produce typed outputs. Such modules typically represent data layers, encoders, decoders, language models, loss functions, or methods of combining activations.\n",

On another user's system, the data might not be placed at exactly the same location, or even on the same drive as specified in the model's config!\n",
