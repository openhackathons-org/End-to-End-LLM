"Climate is the average of the weather conditions at a particular point on the Earth. Typically, climate is expressed in terms of expected temperature, rainfall and wind conditions based on historical observations. Climate change is a change in either the average climate or climate variability that persists over an extended period."
"The Earth's climate has always changed. Changes in the Earth's orbit, the energy output of the sun, volcanic activity, the geographic distribution of the Earth's land masses and other internal or external processes can influence climate. Scientists refer to this type of long-term climate change as natural climate change"
"Although the terms climate change and global warming are often used interchangeably, climate change is a broader term that incorporates both global warming and other observed changes in climate. Many scientists argue that the impacts of climate change will be devastating for natural and human systems and that climate change poses an existential threat to human civilisation."
