Everyday social practices like eating, working, moving about, and heating and cooling our homes result in emissions of greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. Further, the causes and impacts of climate change are unevenly distributed, raising questions of social justice. In general, wealthier countries produce more greenhouse gas emissions per person, whereas poorer countries tend to be more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Proposed responses to climate change also have social impacts that are unevenly distributed. Consequently, climate change poses the first truly global social dilemma, and it is one that has proven politically intractable at multiple governance scales.",
