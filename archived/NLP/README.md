# End-to-End NLP Bootcamp

The End-to-End Natural Language Processing (NLP) Bootcamp is designed from a real-world perspective that follows the data processing, development, and deployment pipeline paradigm. Attendees walk through the workflow of preprocessing raw text data and learn how to build a SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset) dataset format for Question Answering, train the dataset using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), an open source machine learning framework for NLP, and deploy the AI pipeline using a GPU-accelerated speech AI SDK.  



## Bootcamp Content

The content is structured in 3 Labs, plus an introductory notebook and three challenge notebooks:

- Overview of **End-To-End NLP** bootcamp
- Lab 1: Data preprocessing
- Lab 2: Training and Fine-tuning with TAO Toolkit
- Lab 3: Custom model deployment on RIVA 
- Challenge 1: building SQuAD dataset 
- Challenge 2: deploying custom model on RIVA



## Tools and Frameworks

The tools and frameworks used in the bootcamp material are as follows:

- [NVIDIA® TAO Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/tao-toolkit)
- [NVIDIA Riva](https://developer.nvidia.com/riva)
- [NVIDIA TensorRT™](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt)
- [Python Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library](https://www.nltk.org/)


## Tutorial duration

The total bootcamp material would take approximately 8 hours. It is recommended to divide the teaching of the material into two days, covering Lab 1 in one session and the rest in the next session.


## Deploying the Bootcamp Material

To deploy the Labs, please refer to the Deployment guide presented [here](https://github.com/openhackathons-org/End-to-End-LLM/blob/main/archived/Deployment_Guide.md)
