# End-to-End LLM Bootcamp

The End-to-End LLM (Large Language Model) Bootcamp is designed from a real-world perspective that follows the data processing, development, and deployment pipeline paradigm. Attendees walk through the workflow of preprocessing the openassistant-guanaco dataset for the Text Generation task and training the dataset using the LLAMA 2 7Billion Model,a pre-trained and fine-tuned LLM. Attendees will also learn to optimize an LLM using NVIDIA® TensorRT™ LLM, an SDK for high-performance large language model inference, understand guardrail prompts and responses from the LLM model using NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails, and deploy the AI pipeline using NVIDIA TensorRT LLM Backend (powered by Triton™ Inference Server), an open-source software that standardizes LLM deployment and execution across every workload.

## Bootcamp Content

This content contains three Labs, plus a challenge notebook:


- Lab 1: Finetuning Llama2 With Custom Data
- Lab 2: Building TensorRT Engine With Finetune Model
- Lab 3: Deploying Finetune Model using Triton Inference Server
- Challenge Lab
- Application of Guardrails (coming soon)
 



## Tools and Frameworks

The tools and frameworks used in the Bootcamp material are as follows:

- [NVIDIA NeMo™](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/generative-ai/nemo-framework/)
- [NVIDIA TensorRT™](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt)
- [NVIDIA Triton™ Inference Server](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/triton-inference-server/)


## Tutorial duration

The total Bootcamp material would take approximately 7 hours and 30 minutes. We recommend dividing the material's teaching into two days, covering Lab 1-3 in one session and the rest in the next session.


## Deploying the Bootcamp Material
